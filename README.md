Project's Title: Learn Basics of JavaScript by building a Role Playing Game.

Project description:
This product is accomplished by Hoang Long Tran with the original ideas and help of freeCodeCamp in order for me to learn and practice the basics of JavaScript with slight implementations of HTML and CSS.
The learning method here is through short excercise request, self-generating code and correcting it through Terminal, Read-Search-Ask and Community Posts. 

*This project is Licence-free.

** I will further update this product with instructions on how to use it, as I advance.

!!** Do not use this product as your answers to your exercises in freeCodeCamp, instead use suggested method to do it yourself.
